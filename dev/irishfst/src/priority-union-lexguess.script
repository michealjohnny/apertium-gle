# Combined Irish Morphology Transducers
# Elaine UÃ­ Dhonnchadha
# Thank you to Mans Hulden for providing flookup tool
# April 2012
#
# This scripts loads multiple transducers on to the stack and 
# saves them in one file 
# Each transducer is consulted in order until one succeeds in 
# recognising the input string
# It allows flookup to function like xerox lookup but without a 
# lookup script
#
# Usage: flookup -a big.fst
